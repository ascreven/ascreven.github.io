      <h4 class='lead text-center'>Why Web Development?</h4>
      <p>I started programming by teaching myself R and Python in effort to advance my career as an economic analyst. Having always loved puzzles I immediately enjoyed what I was learning but felt like creativity was limited. A friend recommended that I start learning JavaScript because it made use of both my analytical and creative tendencies. I immediately agreed and loved it so much I left my job as an analyst to study web development full time at General Assembly. As graduation from the program creeps up I am very excited to implement and continue developing my dev skills throughout my career.</p>
